## BENEFITS

---

## 1. GET `company/benefit`

### Route
```
GET /wapi/company/benefit
```

### Auth
JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.
**Permission guard:** `checkMenuAccess($login_user_id, $companyId, 10)`. Returns **403** if denied.

### DB Queries
```
UserModel::get_company_benefit($companyId)
  → SELECT * FROM company_benefits
    JOIN benefits ON company_benefits.benefit_id = benefits.id
    WHERE company_benefits.company_id = {companyId}
    AND company_benefits.is_deleted = 0
```

### Request
No body params.

### Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "messages": "benefit list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Health Insurance",
      "benefit_description": "Comprehensive health coverage for employees",
      "image": "https://s3.../benefit-icon.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 2. POST `company/addBenafit` (Create / Update)

### Route
```
POST /wapi/company/addBenafit         → Create new benefit
POST /wapi/company/addBenafit/{id}    → Update existing benefit
```

### Auth
JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.

### DB Queries
```
1. Validate: benefit_id required

2. If benefit_id is string (not int):
   a. check_record_exit('benefits', name) → check if benefit type exists
   b. If not: INSERT INTO benefits (name, user_defined=1, user_id, status=1)

3. Check duplicate: SELECT * FROM company_benefits
   WHERE company_id = {companyId} AND benefit_id = {benefitId} AND is_deleted = 0
   → If exists: "Record Already added!"

4. IF $id provided (update):
   UPDATE company_benefits SET benefit_id, sortOrder, description, modify_date WHERE id = {$id}

5. ELSE (create):
   INSERT INTO company_benefits (company_id, benefit_id, sortOrder, description, create_date, modify_date)
```

### Request
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `benefit_id` | string/int | Yes | Benefit type ID (int) or name (string, auto-creates) |
| `sortOrder` | string | No | Display order |
| `description` | string | No | Benefit description |

### Response
```json
{ "status": true, "messages": "Successfully added" }
```
```json
{ "status": false, "messages": "benefit_id is required." }
{ "status": false, "messages": "Record Already added!" }
```

### Notes
- `benefit_id` accepts either an existing ID (int) or a new name (string) — auto-creates if new.
- Duplicate check: same company + same benefit_id = rejected.
- Update mode (`$id`) does NOT check for duplicates (allows updating existing).

---

## 3. DELETE `company/deleteBenafit/(:num)`

### Route
```
DELETE /wapi/company/deleteBenafit/{id}
```
- `(:num)` → `$id` — company_benefits record ID

### Auth
JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.

### DB Queries
```
1. SELECT * FROM company_benefits WHERE id = {id} AND company_id = {companyId}
   → Verify record exists and belongs to company

2. UPDATE company_benefits SET is_deleted = 1 WHERE id = {id} AND company_id = {companyId}
   → Soft delete
```

### Request
| Field | Source | Required | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| `$id` | URL segment | Yes | company_benefits record ID |

### Response
```json
{ "status": true, "messages": "Delete Successfully" }
```
```json
{ "status": false, "message": "Id is required!" }
{ "status": false, "messages": "Invalid Id" }
```

---

## GALLERY

---

## 4. GET `company/gallery`

### Route
```
GET /wapi/company/gallery
```

### Auth
JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.

### DB Queries
```
MainModel::all_fetch('galleries', array('company_id' => $companyId, 'is_deleted' => 0))
  → SELECT * FROM galleries WHERE company_id = {companyId} AND is_deleted = 0
```

### Request
No body params.

### Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "messages": "gallery list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,

      "description": "",
      "image": "https://s3.../gallery-img.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 5. POST `company/addGallery` (Upload)

### Route
```
POST /wapi/company/addGallery
```

### Auth
JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.

### DB Queries
```
1. Validate: file uploaded, max 3MB, JPG/JPEG/PNG/WEBP only

2. For each uploaded file:
   a. S3 upload via s3fileUploads($file, 'uploads/images/')
   b. INSERT INTO galleries (company_id, name, image, create_date, modify_date)
```

### Request
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `file` | file[] | Yes | Multiple images, max 3MB each (JPG/PNG/WEBP) |
| `title` | string/array | No | Image name(s); array for multiple, single string for all |

### Response
```json
{ "status": true, "messages": "Successfully added" }
```
```json
{ "status": true, "messages": "Nothing Modified !" }   // when no files uploaded
```
```json
{ "status": false, "messages": "You must upload file as png,jpg," }
```

### Notes
- Supports **multiple file upload** — each file creates a separate `galleries` row.
- `title` can be a string (same name for all) or array (individual names per image).
- Update mode (`$id` route) exists in routes but the handler **always creates** new records (update code is commented out).
- Images uploaded to S3 via `s3fileUploads()`.

---

## 6. DELETE `company/deleteGallery/(:num)`

### Route
```
DELETE /wapi/company/deleteGallery/{id}
```
- `(:num)` → `$id` — galleries record ID

JWT required. `$this->request->id` = company ID.

### DB Queries
```
1. SELECT * FROM galleries WHERE id = {id} AND company_id = {companyId}
   → Verify record exists and belongs to company

2. UPDATE galleries SET is_deleted = 1 WHERE id = {id} AND company_id = {companyId}
   → Soft delete
```

### Request
| Field | Source | Required | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|

## Cross-Language Porting Notes

### benefit / addBenafit / deleteBenafit
- **Two-table design**: `benefits` (lookup: benefit types) + `company_benefits` (junction: company-specific benefits).
- `addBenafit` auto-creates new benefit types if string name provided (with `user_defined=1` flag).
- Duplicate check: same company + same benefit_id = rejected on create.
- Soft delete (`is_deleted = 1`) on `company_benefits` table.
- Permission guard uses menu ID `10`.

### gallery / addGallery / deleteGallery
- **Single table**: `galleries` with `company_id`, `name`, `image`, `is_deleted`.
- Supports **multi-file upload** — each file creates a separate row.
- `title` can be string (same for all) or array (per-image names).
- Update route exists but handler **always creates** (update code commented out).
- Soft delete (`is_deleted = 1`).
- Permission guard uses menu ID `9`.
- Images uploaded to S3 at `uploads/images/` path.
